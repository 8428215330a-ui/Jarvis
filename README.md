JARVIS – Intelligent Assistive System for People with Disabilities

Inspired by Tony Stark’s JARVIS, built to empower humanity.

JARVIS is an AI-powered assistive system designed to help people with disabilities, especially visually impaired (blind) individuals, interact with the world independently.
It acts as a digital eye, voice, and brain, enabling users to communicate, understand their surroundings, and perform everyday activities like a normal person.

JARVIS combines speech, vision, sign language understanding, and intelligent responses into one unified system.

🎯 Vision
